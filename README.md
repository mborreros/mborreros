### Boop 🐕


My name is Maya Borrero. I have spent the last 10 years of my life serving people and becoming a queen of customer service (and I am only 24, so that's a little wild). This past year I decided to being a new journey in computer programming to challenge myself and get away from the monotony of the retail day-to-day. I graduated Flatiron School and am now embarking on my job search! These are my projects and my coding work. I pride myself on always learning, getting my hands dirty, and asking meaningful questions. Don't hesitate to reach out!


🤠 I'm currently working on my personal brand (who knew Twitter was professional now, y'know?)

🧑🏽‍🌾 I'm currently learning how to build mods for games like Stardew Valley. I would love to learn about how to mod the Sims in the future!

🧚🏼‍ I'm looking to collaborate. Period. I would love to work with anyone on their current project. I am really interested in backend code (Ruby and Ruby on Rails). I love a good challenge and would like to work on your team. 

💞 I'm looking for help with networking. I would love to chat and connect with you!

🐑 Ask me about anything cozy related. I am a cozy girl who loves reading, puzzling, gaming, baking, cooking, and home-making. 

💌 Call me, beep me, if you want to reach me -> mayaborrero@outlook.com

👼🏼 Silly little facts about me: I recently moved to the South from Philadelphia, PA. I have celiac disease. I am Colombian and fluent in Spanish. I have owned and played every version of the Sims since their intial release. I am adopting a boston terrier in the coming month!
